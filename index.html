      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always had a passion for web development since I worked at intel shortly after highschool.
        Before begining to teach myself coding, I was very active and designing websites with photoshop for other
        people. Now I enjoy taking the "pretty picture" and making it work in website form.
